00:00.900 --> 00:02.090
Hi there!

1
00:02.220 --> 00:05.070
This is our Udemy course on Microsoft SQL Server

2
00:05.070 --> 00:13.640
Microsoft SQL server is the most popular relational database system for the Microsoft

3
00:13.730 --> 00:14.550
operating system.

4
00:15.920 --> 00:26.150
So without further ado, let's get started and install SQL Server and SQL management studio.

5
00:26.550 --> 00:33.690
This is a Udemy course about Microsoft SQL server; I'm firstly going to demonstrate how to download

6
00:33.690 --> 00:42.240
and install SQL Server and SQL Server Management studio which will need to access SQL Server.

7
00:42.910 --> 00:46.850
So do a google search for Microsoft SQL Server express edition.

8
00:46.870 --> 00:49.850
This is a free version that will get you started.

9
00:50.950 --> 00:55.930
This is the home page on Microsoft and we shall just go ahead and press the download button.

10
01:08.380 --> 01:16.110
We want to go for a basic installation; accept the agreement ; install to the default location

11
01:19.280 --> 01:21.890
and we're now going to wait for the download to complete

12
01:35.450 --> 01:39.350
Once SQL Server Express edition is installed.

13
01:39.410 --> 01:47.330
We're going to go ahead and install SSMS or SQL Server Management studio; by pressing this button

14
01:47.510 --> 01:50.450
which will link to the download page on Microsoft

15
01:53.220 --> 01:54.300
Press the download button.

16
01:58.840 --> 02:01.210
And we shall wait for that to download.

17
02:01.400 --> 02:01.970
Five minutes

18
02:06.230 --> 02:11.810
Once SQL Server Management studio is downloaded; open the executable to begin the installation

19
02:24.910 --> 02:33.010
to open SQL Server Management studio; go to the search bar; and type in SQL; The best match should be

20
02:33.220 --> 02:35.890
Microsoft SQL Server Management studio; click this

21
02:39.930 --> 02:47.400
once opened your server name should be prefilled in this box; leave authentication as windows authentication

22
02:47.490 --> 02:56.470
and press connect. At the moment this database sever has no databases; I'm now going to create a new database

23
02:57.630 --> 02:59.170
and I want to call it library

24
03:02.500 --> 03:15.280
press OK; and our new database is now created. This database is empty; it has no tables or any data inside it but

25
03:15.280 --> 03:16.770
we're going to leave it like that for the moment

26
03:19.580 --> 03:28.490
another option instead of installing SQL server locally on your computer is to use Microsoft Azure

27
03:28.490 --> 03:38.540
platform; so you can setup an SQL server instance on Microsoft Azure. Using Microsoft's cloud

28
03:38.540 --> 03:46.800
platform would allow you to scale your database as you grow however this step requires you to have an

29
03:46.830 --> 03:55.490
active Microsoft Azure account and may incur costs; you can skip this step if you do not wish to use

30
03:56.000 --> 03:57.140
Microsoft Azure

31
04:00.240 --> 04:06.450
The next demonstration I'm going to do is how to setup the same SQL Server database; but this time hosted on

32
04:06.690 --> 04:15.450
Azure which is Microsoft's cloud platform offering; so using cloud platforms you don't need to install

33
04:15.450 --> 04:16.370
software locally.

34
04:17.550 --> 04:27.300
So we should set up the same database; click on SQL Server databases. Create SQL database

35
04:32.940 --> 04:37.930
In here we enter the name of the database in which we are going to call it library.

36
04:38.150 --> 04:38.850
As before

37
04:42.120 --> 04:44.580
we press review and create

38
04:51.780 --> 04:53.630
This will take a few seconds to create

39
05:02.710 --> 05:09.010
so once the database is created; first thing I'm going to do is set the password; 

40
05:09.010 --> 05:09.990
So click on the server name here.

41
05:12.430 --> 05:18.860
I want to press reset password; now in order to generate a strong password.

42
05:18.890 --> 05:21.450
You can type whatever you want.

43
05:22.700 --> 05:25.430
If it follows those rules.

44
05:26.780 --> 05:30.530
What I like using is a website called strong password generator.

45
05:32.910 --> 05:34.080
Generate password.

46
05:34.720 --> 05:40.500
And this is a strong password which I can use; paste it into both boxes

47
05:43.100 --> 05:57.180
and press save.

48
06:00.030 --> 06:03.360
You should have SQL Server Management studio open from earlier.

49
06:04.330 --> 06:08.130
And I'm going to enter in the server name.

50
06:08.220 --> 06:08.600
Copy

51
06:11.850 --> 06:14.900
change windows authentication to SQL server authentication.

52
06:17.580 --> 06:19.870
Login should be the server admin here.

53
06:20.120 --> 06:23.120
It would be different for your account.

54
06:23.160 --> 06:29.730
The password will be from whatever you typed in or from this Web site.

55
06:29.730 --> 06:34.390
The secure password generator and press connect.

56
06:41.590 --> 06:43.300
We now expand this.

57
06:43.340 --> 06:52.780
We should see database setup with the database library accessible.

58
06:52.840 --> 06:58.250
This has no tables associated with it. But this is hosted on Azure

59
07:01.960 --> 07:03.360
once you're finished with this.

60
07:04.180 --> 07:10.750
And if you do not want to continue using Azure since there are certain costs associated with using

61
07:10.900 --> 07:14.730
Microsoft Azure, you can delete your database afterwards.

62
07:14.980 --> 07:22.970
Click on SQL databases; click on your database; and press DELETE button, type the word yes, and delete.

63
07:30.280 --> 07:39.450
An alternative to using Microsoft Azure is Amazon's Web Services so if you'd prefer to use Amazon's cloud

64
07:39.450 --> 07:46.530
platform or AWS short for Amazon Web Services then you can also set up an SQL server instance

65
07:46.920 --> 07:49.750
on the AWS platform.

66
07:50.940 --> 07:58.790
As before this step requires you to have an active AWS account and may incur costs.

67
07:58.790 --> 08:02.390
You can skip the step if you didn't wish to use AWS

68
08:10.840 --> 08:20.380
another cloud platform for hosting SQL Server databases is Amazon's AWS or Amazon Web Services.

69
08:20.440 --> 08:24.340
This is an alternative to Azure but is rather similar to it.

70
08:25.930 --> 08:34.480
So to get started log into the AWS management console search for RDS which is 

71
08:35.200 --> 08:36.040
managed relational database service

72
08:44.520 --> 08:45.070
now.

73
08:45.270 --> 08:46.980
If you press create database

74
08:49.690 --> 08:56.420
you can select different types of databases here but we're going for the Microsoft SQL server

75
08:56.420 --> 09:01.010
going for the express addition; once again for cost reasons.

76
09:02.090 --> 09:03.320
Select free tier

77
09:06.560 --> 09:09.340
I'm going to call the database "library"

78
09:15.050 --> 09:20.110
the username "admin" is fine; for the master password.

79
09:20.110 --> 09:25.920
I'm going to once again go to the passwords generator.net Web site.

80
09:25.940 --> 09:30.090
You can obviously type in your own password here.

81
09:30.290 --> 09:37.650
I've selected to exclude symbols and this option copy the password.

82
09:39.620 --> 09:41.880
And that is the master password.

83
09:41.910 --> 09:42.630
Confirm it.

84
09:45.230 --> 09:49.160
You shall accept the default settings for everything else.

85
09:55.020 --> 09:56.830
This case I had to select library2

86
10:02.850 --> 10:11.040
this is creating; it will stay in the state for a few minutes so make yourself a cup of coffee and come

87
10:11.040 --> 10:11.280
back.

88
10:15.870 --> 10:22.860
Now our database is now created but we have to make two changes in order to make this database publicly

89
10:22.860 --> 10:25.110
accessible.

90
10:25.110 --> 10:28.460
Click on the database; click on modify;

91
10:34.180 --> 10:35.590
scroll down this page

92
10:38.480 --> 10:42.130
until you see public accessibility.

93
10:42.140 --> 10:47.580
This allows the database to be connected to from outside of the Amazon Network so we press

94
10:47.600 --> 10:48.600
Yes.

95
10:49.070 --> 10:55.520
Scroll to the bottom of the page and press continue, and modify

96
10:59.830 --> 11:06.710
after the status returns from the modifying state to the available state.

97
11:08.590 --> 11:18.580
We can now update the database so that it will accept connections from outside of the Amazon Network.

98
11:18.580 --> 11:21.880
To do this we need to update the firewall associated with database

99
11:24.450 --> 11:27.410
security; VPC security groups.

100
11:27.450 --> 11:28.380
Click this link here

101
11:32.510 --> 11:43.230
now select the Inbound tab; now you need to edit the rules; add a rule

102
11:44.140 --> 11:44.770
All traffic

103
11:49.050 --> 11:53.530
from my IP; press save

104
11:58.540 --> 11:59.890
turning back to the database.

105
12:04.820 --> 12:15.200
Once we have enabled public access and modified the firewall to allow access from this IP address we

106
12:15.200 --> 12:16.050
can now connect to it.

107
12:17.150 --> 12:19.980
Click on the database once again.

108
12:20.360 --> 12:28.700
Copy the endpoint; open your local copy of Microsoft SQL server management studio.

109
12:28.840 --> 12:32.440
Paste the end point into the server name address; 

110
12:32.520 --> 12:37.180
Log in as admin as earlier; password was the password we chose earlier.

111
12:40.930 --> 12:43.720
Now I'm expecting an issue here.

112
12:43.750 --> 12:47.210
When I try to connect; I shall demonstrate the problem.

113
12:49.800 --> 12:58.380
When trying to connect it's giving me this rather horrible message saying that the SSL certificate has

114
12:58.380 --> 13:01.140
not been trusted.

115
13:01.460 --> 13:03.110
There's nothing to worry about.

116
13:03.680 --> 13:06.430
The SSL cert can be trusted.

117
13:06.890 --> 13:10.340
You just need to change an option here.

118
13:10.430 --> 13:16.990
Press options; press trust server certificates; and that press connect.

119
13:21.190 --> 13:24.940
Now we're connected.

120
13:25.240 --> 13:32.470
We have a database server with no databases in it; but as before we can select new database

121
13:38.830 --> 13:40.180
and we shall call it library

122
13:58.970 --> 14:05.490
and now we have a library database which we use as if it was on our local machine.

123
14:05.520 --> 14:11.960
But this is hosted on Amazon AWS

124
14:11.970 --> 14:16.470
Both Amazon and Azure can incur costs.

125
14:16.620 --> 14:23.670
So if you don't intend to use the database I would recommend that you delete it afterwards.

126
14:23.880 --> 14:32.350
So go back to your database; select the database; press actions and delete

127
14:37.610 --> 14:42.180
final snapshot is not required; I acknowledge.

128
14:42.190 --> 14:53.690
Type in delete me into the box provided press delete on this database will be deleted pretty shortly.
