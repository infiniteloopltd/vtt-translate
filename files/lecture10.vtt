SQL Server jobs; scheduling work. SQL Server jobs.

1
00:07.980 --> 00:14.490
SQL Service agent is available for the developer, web, standard and enterprise editions of SQL Server

2
00:15.000 --> 00:22.440
but not SQL server express. SQL Server agent allows you to schedule jobs to be run on your database

3
00:22.590 --> 00:24.590
server on a regular basis.

4
00:27.210 --> 00:32.700
Video demonstration. Here we will demonstrate how to set up a SQL server job to backup your database

5
00:32.700 --> 00:34.590
nightly, and compress the backup.

6
00:36.060 --> 00:42.910
Ok here we will demonstrate how to setup a SQL server job to backup your database nightly, and compress

7
00:42.930 --> 00:43.450
the backup.

8
00:44.430 --> 00:50.280
So the first thing we'll do is we'll write the script within the SQL server management studio and then

9
00:50.280 --> 00:53.330
we shall create a job from that script.

10
00:53.460 --> 00:55.760
So let's get started.

11
00:55.760 --> 00:58.130
Now to backup a database.

12
00:58.290 --> 01:05.670
So if you've been following previous lessons you may have a backup already in c:\temp

13
01:05.670 --> 01:09.020
but let's delete this backup.

14
01:12.940 --> 01:21.420
Like so; so the script is: 

15
01:26.470 --> 01:31.120
backup database library to disk = 'C:\temp\library.bak'

16
01:35.660 --> 01:38.790
Execute; OK.

17
01:38.900 --> 01:42.940
We'll check our temp folder and we've got a backup file.

18
01:42.960 --> 01:50.220
Now we want to zip this; 

19
01:50.790 --> 02:00.380
xp_cmdshell '"C:\program-files\7-zip\7z" a c:\temp\library.zip c:\temp\library.bak'

20
02:00.390 --> 02:12.300
xp_cmdshell '"C:\program-files\7-zip\7z" a c:\temp\library.zip c:\temp\library.bak'

21
02:12.330 --> 02:21.520
xp_cmdshell '"C:\program-files\7-zip\7z" a c:\temp\library.zip c:\temp\library.bak'

22
02:22.990 --> 02:30.700
Okay so once that zip process has completed we can open up the C:\temp

23
02:30.720 --> 02:37.020
and we should see two files library.bak and library.zip where the library.zip contains

24
02:37.020 --> 02:38.070
library.bak.

25
02:38.120 --> 02:38.710
Perfect.

26
02:39.270 --> 02:39.530
Okay.

27
02:39.570 --> 02:44.410
So the next step is we want to automate this process to run this on a nightly basis.

28
02:44.610 --> 02:50.490
So we do that through SQL Service agent, Now SQL server agent will be available on SQL Server developer

29
02:50.490 --> 02:56.610
edition, SQL server web edition, standard and enterprise but won't be available on SQL Server Express.

30
02:56.730 --> 02:59.650
So make sure you're using the right version of SQL server.

31
02:59.860 --> 03:05.010
Now we right click on SQL Server agent; press new job.

32
03:05.160 --> 03:10.180
Give the job a name we'll call it a backup.

33
03:10.860 --> 03:12.570
Give it a a description.

34
03:12.570 --> 03:17.720
This backs up the database every night.

35
03:18.480 --> 03:23.080
You can give it a more meaningful description; press steps.

36
03:23.190 --> 03:23.790
New step

37
03:27.170 --> 03:27.520
step name

38
03:27.520 --> 03:31.910
backup database.

39
03:31.960 --> 03:34.230
Give it a command which is this

40
03:37.650 --> 03:39.070
and...

41
03:39.590 --> 03:40.060
Press.

42
03:40.160 --> 03:41.080
Okay.

43
03:41.240 --> 03:43.480
We create the second step.

44
03:46.030 --> 03:46.900
We should use this

45
03:50.660 --> 03:54.970
and we'll call it "Zip the backup"

46
03:55.200 --> 03:56.240
OK.

47
03:56.330 --> 04:01.670
Now if we expand this we can see that each steps has an on on success and on failure.

48
04:01.670 --> 04:05.790
This means that if the first step succeeds it will go to the next step.

49
04:05.840 --> 04:10.630
If it fails it will quit the job and will not go to the next step.

50
04:10.640 --> 04:16.340
There's no point in zipping the backup if the backup has failed it'll be an old backup or an invalid

51
04:16.340 --> 04:21.040
backup and the final step.

52
04:21.050 --> 04:28.250
We can change this so that it reports success.

53
04:28.250 --> 04:34.360
So quit the job reporting success so this means the final step it'll quit the job reporting success.

54
04:34.400 --> 04:40.480
Now we should give it a schedule test new and we'll call the schedule nightly.

55
04:40.880 --> 04:44.150
So we say it occurs on a daily basis.

56
04:44.150 --> 04:46.600
Let's say you want it to run at 1am

57
04:47.050 --> 04:49.070
It's the best idea to actually run these jobs.

58
04:49.130 --> 04:57.120
At times when your users aren't actively using the database so that you don't slow them down.

59
04:57.370 --> 04:58.440
OK.

60
04:58.590 --> 04:59.340
And press ok

61
04:59.390 --> 05:07.110
OK now once you've created the job it's a good idea to test it to make sure it works.

62
05:07.130 --> 05:13.670
So what we're gonna do is we're going to delete the backups and zip so go into the temp folder again

63
05:14.560 --> 05:17.120
delete the backup and zip.

64
05:17.120 --> 05:21.850
Now we're going to run the job.

65
05:22.190 --> 05:26.300
You could of course wait until 1 a.m. in the morning but let's do it straight away.

66
05:27.650 --> 05:28.730
So let's run

67
05:32.580 --> 05:34.880
we've got reported success.

68
05:35.190 --> 05:41.700
We can close this window and check our temp folder and we can see that these two files have not been

69
05:41.700 --> 05:42.360
recreated.

70
05:42.390 --> 05:44.480
Which is perfect.

71
05:44.700 --> 05:51.330
Managing SQL server jobs; You can use the SQL server management studio interface to view the history

72
05:51.330 --> 05:56.940
of jobs from via SQL server agent can also disable and delete jobs from the interface if you no

73
05:56.940 --> 05:59.690
longer need them.

74
05:59.770 --> 06:03.780
Video demonstration: Here we will view the history of the job we've just created.

75
06:05.220 --> 06:13.560
Okay here we will view the history of the job we just created so we can right click on the job;

76
06:14.000 --> 06:23.610
press view history and you can expand at this to see what has happened so we can see the date and time the

77
06:23.640 --> 06:25.260
job was run.

78
06:25.350 --> 06:29.660
We can see the green arrows means that it was successful; step succeeded.

79
06:29.700 --> 06:32.240
We have more information there.

80
06:34.900 --> 06:41.350
For instance we can expand this and we can see the information returned from 7zip

81
06:44.660 --> 06:50.280
we can also right click on the job and select disable.

82
06:50.370 --> 06:57.330
If we do not want the jobs to run tonight for some reason and enable it again when you want the job

83
06:57.340 --> 07:02.400
to run; and that's all there is to it. And it's over to you.

84
07:03.090 --> 07:09.150
Let's see if we can use a SQL server job history to diagnose the problem first uninstall 7zip

85
07:09.160 --> 07:15.210
from your computer and re-run the job then you SQL server job history to diagnose the problem

86
07:15.210 --> 07:17.390
fix it; and verify the fix.

87
07:17.460 --> 07:23.270
You can pause this video now and resume it when you wish to view the solution.

88
07:23.600 --> 07:29.970
Okay for this task we're going to cause a problem then diagnose and fix it again.

89
07:31.410 --> 07:40.220
So what we're going to do is delete 7zip; so we right click on the7Zip folder; click on the uninstall program

90
07:40.860 --> 07:45.860
and this will uninstall 7zip.

91
07:46.760 --> 07:53.410
We'll also delete our backup.

92
07:53.600 --> 07:55.980
Now let's run the nightly backup job.

93
08:03.680 --> 08:04.620
Says success.

94
08:04.680 --> 08:07.730
However if we look in the temp folder we have library that back.

95
08:07.740 --> 08:09.240
But there is no library.zip.

96
08:11.070 --> 08:20.280
So if we right click on this view history and the latest one

97
08:23.260 --> 08:26.810
this says the step succeeded but it didn't.

98
08:26.820 --> 08:30.540
So we should just reinstall 7Zip

99
08:38.670 --> 08:46.060
Default location; and re-run the job

100
08:54.480 --> 08:54.980
OK.

101
08:55.030 --> 09:01.000
Once complete check the temp folder and those files are now there; perfect.
